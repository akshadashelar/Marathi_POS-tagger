# Unigram tagger technique for POS tagging

## POS TAGGING WITH NLTK:


The primary target of Part-of-Speech(POS) tagging is to identify the grammatical
group of a given word. Whether it is a NOUN, PRONOUN, ADJECTIVE, VERB,
ADVERBS, etc. based on the context. POS Tagging looks for relationships within
the sentence and assigns a corresponding tag to the word.


#### I trained a Unigram POS Tagger provided by the NLTK library to train on the Marathi corpus.

## GOALS:

You can split the Marathi Corpus dataset into train and validation sets. The goal of a POS tagger is to assign linguistic (mostly grammatical) information to sub-sentential units.

You need to accomplish the following in this assignment:
* Write the unigram tagger algorithm for assigning POS tags.
* Compare the tagging accuracy after making these modifications with the unigram algorithm.

## USE CASES OF POS TAGS:
POS applications can be found in various tasks such as 
* Information retrieval, information extraction
* Parsing
* Text to Speech (TTS) applications
* Linguistic research for corpora.
 
## REQUIREMENTS:
Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install python package manager.
```bash
pip install nltk
pip install pandas
```
